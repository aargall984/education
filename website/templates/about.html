            <h2>Who is Mr. Argall?</h2>
            <p>Hello to students and parents, my name is Andrew Argall and I am a teacher-candidate (or
            preservice teacher) studying at Nipissing University in beautiful North Bay, Ontario. I
            am originally from Gore Bay, right here on Manitoulin Island. I attended secondary
            school at Manitoulin Secondary School, after which I completed my Bachelor of Science at
            the University of Guelph, specializing in biological and medical physics.</p>
            <h3>Teaching with Technology Philosophy</h3>
            <p> A university professor of mine used to say, “the physics is done - there is only algebra left”. This has always stuck with me for two reasons: firstly, he was a wonderful professor whose class was a joy to be in. Secondly, it made me realize that although most of the writing on a physics test is math, the math itself is not physics. More succinctly, no matter how much evaluation you do as a teacher you can never see the really important work being done in your students’ minds. Historically people have believed that we as teachers are teaching math, english, science, or a host of other subjects. Education is being studied in increasingly rigorous and academic ways, which has quickly lead to the conclusion that we are in fact teaching young people. Young people with character, hobbies, interests, feelings, and yes sometimes a bit of attitude! The role of a teacher has always been to equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in life. The real challenge (and reward!) behind the role is finding the best way for every student to learn, which for many modern students is through the use of technologies like computers, tablets, and phones. I believe much of the pushback to these ideas comes from experienced teachers who never had the type of integration of tech into their daily lives as some of their younger colleagues, which understandably leads to them being uncomfortable using these tools in their classrooms. There is a lot to learn, and I believe it is the responsibility of teachers today to educate themselves in order to enhance their teaching with technology.
            </p>
            <p>The world is changing rapidly, with everyday tasks like going to the bank and cashing a cheque are being done by our smartphones anywhere in the world. Many times students are more up to date with the latest trends and inventions than their teachers or guardians. I do not believe it is realistic to expect curriculum content  in conjunction with traditional learning techniques to compete with the technology-based stimulus students experience outside of the classroom. By bringing technological learning activities to the classroom we are able to make content relevant to students and allow them to learn and work in a virtual environment where they are often most comfortable. My favourite part about technology is that it enables students to communicate their understanding and abilities in subjects like science and art without being hindered by difficulties they may have in reading and writing.
            </p>
            <p>Tech integration takes many forms in my classroom, and it is a constantly changing landscape. A lot of our lessons are centered around the Smart Board, an extremely powerful tool that while being very common isn’t always used to its potential. The Smart Board provides opportunities to involve students directly with instruction, students can spend more time participating and less time watching me write things! The Chromebooks in our classroom really revolutionize the way students complete work. They are used for reading, writing, watching videos, collaborating and countless other tasks. Using laptops in the classroom puts is a big responsibility for students, both caring for the well-being of an expensive device and keeping on task with the endless internet at their fingertips. We also use tablets, which I am looking forward to using more with regards to developing technologies (hint: augmented reality!).
            </p>
            <p>I think it's fair to say even the coolest teacher is never “with it” as far as the culture of their students is concerned (that statement makes me seem a lot older than I am!). Even a young teacher like myself never lived as an elementary or secondary student in this diverse and globalized society. A world where a fifteen or twenty second video clip can go viral and start a world-wide trend, resulting in millions of adolescents dropping the newest dance move in class. A world where your social worth is dominated by your online representation. As teachers we need to not only avoid suppressing students’ culture, but encourage them to use it to motivate the content of their work. Teachers now have the responsibility of teaching skills that have never been needed before, like internet safety, identifying and preventing cyberbullying, and a lifestyle with a healthy moderation of screen time. Times are changing, and we need to keep up.
            </p>
            <p>Most teachers will tell you the thing they most want from their students is respect, and it is rightfully a core value of many classrooms. As a teacher who does their best to incorporate technology I believe the responsibility of my students is to respect the effort that it takes and provide constructive feedback. I want to know about what the popular game is. I want to know what the new social media trends are. The more information students can give me about topics and technologies that are important to them the more I can involve those things in their learning. Learning the right approach to that feedback brings us back to respect. Shouting “This is stupid!” in the middle of an activity won’t get us anywhere. Coming up to me after a lesson and saying, “Mr. Argall, I appreciate that you let us use our smartphones during this lesson - but here are some ways you could have done it better…”. Now that is how we create a tech-savvy classroom we all want to spend 200 days a year in.
            </p>
            <p>A common saying goes, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. I think this position is the wrong one to have as a teacher - just because something has done the trick in the past doesn’t mean there is no room for improvement. I believe there is a way for nearly every lesson out there that can incorporate technology, it just requires the effort and time to make it happen. Much like learning a new language the key isn’t thinking traditional and translating to modern, it’s thinking modern from day one. The first sight I have set my eye regarding technological integration is for assessment. Its my opinion that if I’m not using digital formative assessments to be able to quickly monitor student progress, while easily protecting student privacy than I am limiting my ability to be an effective teacher. I could do this with Plicker, or Google Classroom quizzes, straw polls - the options or endless. In addition to assessment, I believe that students ability to typeset their writing effectively is an essential life skills that needs to be developed in conjunction with traditional writing skills. I believe that being a champion for technology-based professional development in my province, school board, and school is the best way for me to not only grow as an educator but also ensure my colleagues are getting the training they need.
